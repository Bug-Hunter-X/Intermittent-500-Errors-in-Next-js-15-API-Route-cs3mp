# Intermittent 500 Errors in Next.js 15 API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications involving intermittent 500 errors from an API route. The API route simulates a scenario where it randomly returns a 500 error, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` file contains an API route that randomly returns either a 200 OK response or a 500 Internal Server Error.  The frontend (`pages/index.js`) uses `useSWR` to fetch data from this route and handles loading and error states. However, the random nature of the error makes consistent reproduction difficult.

## Solution

The solution focuses on improving error handling and logging to better diagnose and address intermittent API errors.  This includes more comprehensive error handling on both the frontend and backend.  Additional logging in the API route provides more data to pinpoint when errors occur, and more detailed error messages on the frontend enhance user experience.
